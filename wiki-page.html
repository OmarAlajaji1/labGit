        <h1>Another name for the brown bear is the grizzly bear</h1>
        <p>Meaning of "grizzly"
            Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly"
             (i.e., "grizzled"â€”that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome").[9]
              The modern spelling supposes the former meaning; even so, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 as U.
               horribilis for its character.[10]</p>
